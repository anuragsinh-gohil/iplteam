# Spring Boot CRUD Operations API

This project is a simple and powerful Spring Boot application that performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a RESTful API. It manages IPL team data and connects seamlessly with a MySQL database to store and retrieve information. The API is built with Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Data JPA, providing an efficient backend system for handling data operations. All endpoints have been tested using Postman to ensure reliable performance. Through this project, users can add new IPL teams, fetch a list of all teams, update existing team information, and delete teams by their ID. The project is designed to be beginner-friendly and demonstrates how to integrate Spring Boot with MySQL, build REST APIs, and test them using Postman. It serves as a solid foundation for anyone looking to learn or showcase their skills in building full-stack Java applications with database connectivity.
